# Data folder

The `data` folder contains two files that are managed by the `manage-channel` and `role-reactions` commands.

## Manage Channel
This command allows you to manage the bot's access to a channel in order to avoid using commands in unauthorized channels.

The `channels.json` file contains:
```js
[]
```

## Role Reaction
This command is used to manage messages with autoroles. These autoroles allow users to choose their role by reacting with a specific emoji.

The `reactions.json` file contains:
```js
{}
```
